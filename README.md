# Sensational Seven Powerplay Codebase

This is the robot controller app code for the Sensational Seven in the 2022-2023 Powerplay season. It's based on the Roadrunner quickstart repository by ACME Robotics (https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner-quickstart)

OpModes and framework code can be found in TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/. Our code is in the s7 and blocks folders, most other code is from Roadrunner.
